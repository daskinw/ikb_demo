# GitBook story

At GitBook, we're building **a new document standard suited for modern work and collaboration**. We're a fully remote and product oriented team. Our ambition is to **empower team's intelligence**! We want to help teams work more efficiently by creating a single place to leverage their knowledge.

GitBook started as a simple open source tool designed to let developers quickly publish content from a git repo. We've changed a bunch since then, but fundamentally we've stayed true to the vision of empowering software teams to document and distribute their knowledge.

### **Where we started**

The first iteration of GitBook was a bootstrapped, developer-focused product built by co-founders Samy and Aaron, allowing folks to publish documentation (or 'books'!) straight from their git repos.

### **Where we're at**

Now, we are a fully remote team building the future of knowledge management, starting with technical teams. GitBook is now used by over **2M users and thousands of teams** such as Adobe, Netflix, Apple, Snyk, and Google and backed by top partners such as P9 Capital, Notion Capital and Fly VC.

### **Where we're heading**

We want GitBook to be a product that continues to power knowledge, and break down silos, across all kinds of great teams. We're pushing ourselves to improve; we treat our company like a product; we take risks together; and fundamentally care about the future of knowledge management.
