# Our cultural principles

{% hint style="info" %}
Our cultural principles are designed to be guidelines to go from where we stand to where we want to go.&#x20;

They reflect us as a team and shape our culture.&#x20;

Every single team member is a value addition to our culture, so it's important for us to state our values.&#x20;

**ðŸ’¥ Bias towards **_**impactful**_** action**

Keep our goal in mind and build towards it

:handshake: **Care (Give a Sh\*t)**

It all starts and ends with us and the people we do this for - put them at the heart of everything you do

:dart: **Transparency**

Make information accessible, in every sense

:brain: **Keep it simple**

There is a lot of complexity in simplicity. It's all about efficiency and how we need to focus on the right things to work smarter
