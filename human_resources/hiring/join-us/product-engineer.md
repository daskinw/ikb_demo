**How we work**

Engineering works to continuously delivering value, focusing on shipping as a team. We use agile processes that work for us and experiment frequently. Our process runs on two week async "cycles" that emphasize leadership through ownership and operating in the open.We leverage Kanban mechanisms that prioritize throughput, velocity, and impact to help us succeed in our mission to foster rewarding relationships between our product and our users. As a product focused organization, Engineering works in tandem with Product, Design, and Support to participate in crafting value throughout the entire product delivery process.

### ü´∂You will be valued for

* **Your product-oriented mindset** You are driven by creating values for our users, and not solely by solving hard tech problems. You have experience owning a project from concept to production, with a focus on the end user and final impact. You approach engineering with an empathy driven mindset that keeps a broader context when executing.
* **Your teamwork** You understand that value is created and delivered to users. You help the team operate openly and transparently, elevating the quality of documentation and our rigour. You grow through experimentation and lead with compassion, improving the organization and your teammates.
* **Your technical experience** You have experience working with TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and serverless architecture.
* **Your engineering skills** You have a solid understanding of how web applications are built and delivered to users. You are comfortable with topics such as performance optimisation, data synchronisation, and caching. Your experience in application monitoring and debugging will also be valued and it will be an added plus if you have experience with server-less infrastructure.

### ‚ú® What's next?

First, we will take the time to review your application, and we will get back to you within a week, regardless of our decision. We know that your time is valuable so we work to move the process along quickly and keep it casual. We're not believers in "gotcha" questions or checking for skills you'll never actually use as an engineer at GitBook.

Here's what our process will look like:

1. **Discovery Call** (30 min) with our People Team to look for healthy alignment
2. **Technical interview** (60 min) with members of the engineering team to learn more about projects you've built and challenges you've faced building them.
3. **Technical interview** (60 min) with Samy, our CTO, to learn more about your experience and technical skills
4. **Final meet & greet with CEO** (30 min)
