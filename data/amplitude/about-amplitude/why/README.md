# Why

## What Amplitude is?

Amplitude is a Product Analytics solution, which aims to answer **product** questions. It's also a versatile solution but it will never replace consolidated BI reporting.&#x20;

## Why do we need it?

As a product lead company, our company's success will be driven by our product success. So having the ability to understand product usage at scale is needed.

## Why do we also use Tableau?

Tableau is used to build cross-functional data reporting or analysis. In Amplitude, we only push product-related data while in Tableau, we have access to our entire data warehouse.

Also, some analyses are not easy to build in Amplitude, so we can build more ad-hoc analyses in SQL and power some chart using Tableau.

While we try our best to make the data accurate, we can't consider Amplitude as the source of truth, especially around conversion
