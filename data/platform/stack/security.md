## BigQuery

We have 3 level of access in BigQuery:

* BigQuery admin at the GCP account: only: only Marcus and [R√©mi Gonnu](https://app.gitbook.com/u/k78HeV171BTeNuwBVhZhs24cN1g1 "mention")
* Data Analyst group in GCP with a dedicated set of access as described [here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/data-dbt/blob/master/models/temporary/permissions/permissions\_data\_analyst.sql)
* Data Reader group in GCP with a dedicated set of access ad described [here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/data-dbt/blob/master/models/temporary/permissions/permissions\_data\_reader.sql)
